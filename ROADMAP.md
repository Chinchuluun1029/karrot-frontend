# Karrot Roadmap

## General Direction as of 2020-11-22

- usability! maybe a pipeline, people notice little niggles, katie can sketch some solutions, and bruno and the students can implement it! supported with Nicks help
- finish the governance design process, let's see about actually implementing
- conceptualizing of karrot itself, values, etc... a clearer message, leading to outreach, what is it and how does it work? a rocket chat channel...?
- generalization progress, continuing momentum
- maintainance + code improvements

## Current Development (higher priority)

We are working on this either right now or pretty soon in the future. Should be implemented in the next few months.

## Current discussion (higher priority)

We want to work on this in mid-term future. We need to think about it more before we can implement it, so active discussion is highly welcome. Feel free to join in!

- [Streamline application flow & remove invitations](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/2080)
- [Choice between "wall" or "activities/pickups" as the default page for a place](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/1703)
- [Hide "give feedback for pickup" on group wall](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/1508)
- [Better handling for much wanted pickups](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/1242)
- [Public locations for food distribution (Food-share points, open fridges)](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/354)

## Discussion (lower priority)

Quite a bit in the future (~1 year), haven't been discussed very much. If one of those is more important to you than those in "Current discussion", please contact us!

- [Allow to choose "did not participate" in pickup feedback](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/1505)
- [Handle late drop-outs from pickups](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/1108)
